# todo-list
 I have been inspired by *@iamshaunjp (#codeNinja)* to create a ToDo List App in order to understand how deployments work (Heroku - free workspace for students) and how could I combine NodeJS with EJS in the front-side.

 You can try to play with this app accessing: http://mcristus-todo.herokuapp.com/todo
